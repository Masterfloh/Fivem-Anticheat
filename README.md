Introducing an open-source FiveM anticheat solution – a tool designed to uphold the integrity of your gaming experience. My anticheat system is provided to the community free of charge, embodying our commitment to fostering fair play and a safe gaming environment for all FiveM enthusiasts.

While im excited to share this resource with the community, it's important to note that my anticheat solution might not be actively maintained and updated. Over time, new cheat methods and techniques may emerge that require constant vigilance and updates to maintain effectiveness.

I recommend using our anticheat system as a foundational template for developers who are passionate about enhancing the FiveM gaming experience. By leveraging our codebase as a starting point, you can learn about anticheat mechanisms, game security protocols, and coding practices. Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your needs, implementing updates and improvements to keep up with the evolving threat landscape.

While my anticheat tool may become slightly outdated, it remains a valuable educational resource for aspiring developers and serves as a starting point for creating a more robust and up-to-date anticheat system. I encourage you to join the community effort to build upon this foundation and develop an anticheat solution that remains effective against emerging cheats and exploits.
